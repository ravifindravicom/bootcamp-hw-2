## Homework Assignment 2

In this homework assignment I created a "my portfolio" web site using Bootstrap.  The result is a hybrid of straight coding  in Visual Studio and using the bootstrap code generated by Bootstrap Studio. This detour via Bootstrap Studio meant that the following known defects, or deviations from requirements, are present:
- I could not reset the media type breakpoint to 400. It appears to work as-is, but I feel it is switching at 576.
- I could not wrap the text in the index.html page around the picture as required in the spec.
- My footer is not sticky.
Attempts to fix the above broke other things, and I am out of time. I still feel Bootstrap Studio is a good tool, but learning it's peculiar way of doing things requires more than the time I budgeted. 

The index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html are the three HTML pages (the About Me link also points to index.html). There were two minor things I needed to over ride in CSS. 

## Deployed To:
The resulting web page has been deployed to:
